This is a project that I am working on to put the knowledge I am attaining from my programming class to the test.
I am Currently taking Com S 227 at Iowa State University.
 
I am planning to make some games after I make all the required card classes. I'm also looking to change the directory
 structure when I know how to, which I will hopefully learn from an SE job.
