# Overview
* This is a project that I am working on to put the knowledge I am attaining from my programming classes to the test.
I am Currently taking CS 228 and CS 230 at Iowa State University.

* I am planning to make some games after I make all the required card classes. I'm also looking to change the directory
structure when I know how to, which I will hopefully learn from an SE job.

* This project has been put on the backburner until I am interested in it more than my Javascript or euler projects
